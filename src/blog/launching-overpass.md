## The Idea

First of all, I think it is worth noting that while I went to college, I did not go to school to be a developer. I was pushed towards development by my first employer, for which I was just a content editor.

I learned development through trial, error, and most importantly, YouTube.

It was not until recently that I realized that while there are a billion tutorials on YouTube, I never came across a service that offered a vital skill that I lacked when I started, pair-programming.

### The Name

I started reaching out to my fellow developers to see if the idea was a turd or not. In those discussions, I found comfort in knowing that most people I talked to seem to really like the idea, and find value in it immediately.

In one particular conversation, we got quite deep into why the service could be valuable. This service was useful to a wide range of developers:

- Newly graduated junior developers
- Backend developers looking to get into frontend
- Frontend developers with expertise in less modern frontend tooling
- Beginners just looking to develop at all

As we discussed this further, we struggled to find a tagline. Eventually, words slipped from my mouth that sparked an idea in my friend's mind:

I said:

> You know, like *bridging the gap* for developers to modern stuff.

He quickly agreed with:

> Yeah, like an *overpass*.

I was sold immediately.

I built the site within the week with a little help from Eleventy, TailwindCSS, Svelte, and Netlify. It's hosted on Netlify too!
